// Who the two ends of this connection actually are.
//
// `welcome.version` is the server's own release version, and `welcome.protocol`
// is the wire version it speaks — the protocol document says the first "exists
// precisely for client/server drift detection". Neither was ever displayed, so
// an operator debugging a table had no way to see which server they were
// talking to short of reading its terminal.
//
// The soft flag is on the PROTOCOL, not on the two product versions: the studio
// and the engine are separate products with separate version lines, so
// comparing "0.1.0" to "2.1.dev141" would flag every healthy connection. A
// different protocol MINOR is the real drift — same major, so the connection is
// sound (the store refuses a major mismatch outright), but one side knows
// frames the other does not.
