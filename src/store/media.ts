// The media family: uploads, the room's picture broadcasts, the keeper's
// upload switch, and avatars.
//
// The protocol splits an upload across two channels, and so does this store.
// The CONTROL half is frames — `media_offer` out, `media_accept` back — and it
// lives here. The BYTE half is a PUT on the media channel, which happens
// natively (`lib/media.ts` → `src-tauri/src/media.rs`) so a 128 MiB audio file
// never crosses the WebView boundary.
//
// Two shapes of accept, both documented and both real:
//   - `{upload_id}` — the room does not have these bytes; PUT them, and the
//     server broadcasts `media` / `audio_library_item` once it has verified the
//     size and sha256 itself.
//   - `{upload_id: "", existing: true, media|audio}` — the room already holds
//     this hash. Nothing to send; the metadata is in the accept.
//
// A pending upload is keyed by sha256, not by upload id: `existing` accepts
// carry no id, and the hash is the only thing both halves of the exchange
// agree on.
